One's life span is around 29,000 days, or 696,000 hours.
Media consumption is a rather large chunk of my life,
that more or less shapes the view I have today.
While we can't live every lifestyle we dream of or experience everything we desire,
media offers us a window into different stories and ways of life.

I wanted to list them out, for myself, for share, or just for the record.
